5/22/16, 5:50:18 PM: Crystal Dang: I'm gonna try to get Chan to talk to me
5/22/16, 5:50:43 PM: Crystal Dang: Or at least for him to let me know if it is or isn't okay to invite her to things
5/22/16, 5:50:57 PM: Kevin: Nice
5/22/16, 5:51:05 PM: Kevin: That would get him to open up to you

5/26/16, 12:59:02 AM: Kevin: and less people will look at every picture
5/26/16, 12:59:31 AM: Kevin: picky to retouch? is it cause the pics are already so clear?
5/26/16, 12:59:42 AM: Kevin: or because retouching might be too obvious?
5/26/16, 1:00:24 AM: Crystal Dang: im very selective
5/26/16, 1:00:51 AM: Crystal Dang: i care more about perfect moments and photo

5/30/16, 6:56:24 PM: Crystal Dang: as in being vague
5/30/16, 6:56:29 PM: Kevin: something that is a bit ambiguous is how big the companies are
5/30/16, 6:56:39 PM: Kevin: so maybe it helps if you say how many customers the cafe has
5/30/16, 6:56:48 PM: Kevin: or like how big the nails company is

5/30/16, 7:05:12 PM: Crystal Dang: 2016-05-30-PHOTO-00003703.jpg <‚Äéattached>
5/30/16, 7:05:13 PM: Kevin: maybe its missing a few action words

5/31/16, 2:36:49 PM: Kevin: If you need to talk, I'll respond with two perspectives

As a friend: you should do this
As kevin: you should do this, and my outfit is lit LOL
5/31/16, 2:37:00 PM: Kevin: If there needs to be two perspectives LOL
5/31/16, 2:37:03 PM: Crystal Dang: LOL

5/31/16, 2:38:26 PM: Crystal Dang: Confused
5/31/16, 2:38:29 PM: Crystal Dang: üòÇ
5/31/16, 2:38:43 PM: Kevin: Did you talk to your sister Yet?
5/31/16, 2:38:48 PM: Kevin: Or that's later tn?
5/31/16, 2:38:51 PM: Crystal Dang: I might see my sis after work

5/31/16, 2:41:30 PM: Crystal Dang: Yupp!

5/31/16, 2:42:55 PM: Crystal Dang: I feel like I'm in a TV show
5/31/16, 2:44:38 PM: Kevin: As kevin: I wish I can be papa dial and comfort you and brush your hair 

As a friend: you should probably isolate yourself away from kevin because that will add fire to the mixed feelings. I think you need time for yourself away from him so you can think critically about it. 

Maybe get rid of that sexual frustrations for yours, to clear your mind. Sexual frustration will make you think irrationally and want intimate situations. If bao can't do it, do it yourself LOL
5/31/16, 2:45:06 PM: Kevin: To your comment, I always surrounded by drama LOL but this is the first time I'm in it
5/31/16, 2:45:14 PM: Kevin: Drama as in, chan and Karen
5/31/16, 2:45:22 PM: Kevin: LOL it's entertaining when it's not me
5/31/16, 2:45:25 PM: Crystal Dang: LOL
5/31/16, 2:45:33 PM: Crystal Dang: I don't have sexual frustration
5/31/16, 2:45:37 PM: Crystal Dang: üôä
5/31/16, 2:45:38 PM: Kevin: LOOOOOL
5/31/16, 2:45:50 PM: Crystal Dang: Putting it out there
5/31/16, 2:45:53 PM: Crystal Dang: Hahaha
5/31/16, 2:46:17 PM: Crystal Dang: It's actually not you
5/31/16, 2:46:35 PM: Kevin: LOL thanks
5/31/16, 2:46:36 PM: Crystal Dang: How do I put this..
5/31/16, 2:46:47 PM: Crystal Dang: You opened my eyes to what's in front of me
5/31/16, 2:46:50 PM: Kevin: I needed to know üòÅ

5/31/16, 2:49:09 PM: Crystal Dang: I think for now, I just need a serious talk with my sis and bao
5/31/16, 2:49:42 PM: Crystal Dang: It'll clear my head to figure out what I want
5/31/16, 2:50:44 PM: Crystal Dang: I don't regret talking to you or getting to know you üòÅ
5/31/16, 2:50:50 PM: Kevin: Yea, it's easy to get a crush with someone. Especially when we chilled consecutively for 3 weeks

6/1/16, 1:57:03 PM: Crystal Dang: I didn't know it was freshco, so annoyingggg üò≠
6/1/16, 1:58:15 PM: Kevin: LOL I never heard it
6/1/16, 1:58:55 PM: Kevin: Yoo I just thought of something, because of the rise of online messaging. Maybe it's possible for someone to be introverts irl, but extroverted online
6/1/16, 1:59:03 PM: Kevin: Hmmmmmmm
6/1/16, 2:03:07 PM: Crystal Dang: Interestingg, it would be totally different online
6/1/16, 2:03:08 PM: Crystal Dang: With those test you feel it's for person to person interaction
6/1/16, 2:03:53 PM: Kevin: Yeaa that's how everyone perceives it
6/1/16, 2:04:05 PM: Kevin: As physical interaction
6/1/16, 2:14:20 PM: Kevin: So a introvert that is active online may sometimes be called an "online extrovert". But that doesn't change that you are introverted. The reason why introverts can be active online is due to the different circumstances on texting vs. talking irl:

6/1/16, 2:19:06 PM: Kevin: Tl Dr reasons:
- introverts take long to articulate their thoughts. Talks irl are too fast for them to reply so they drop their thoughts and just move on

- introverts are easily simulated by things(more than extroverts), social conversations have too much sensory data to consume. Body gesture , tone of voice, eyes, facial expressions. Too much consumption of data will cloud up the brain, -> slow replies.
- follow up point, extroverts can unconsciously block out the extra stimulants

- that's why they like to talk online, cause it allows them to response when they want. They can proof read their messages until they are satisfied their thoughts are conveyed correctly

6/21/16, 8:58:11 AM: Kevin: Reminder:
Just listened to a podcast about languages. Can you think without language? Can you have inner thoughts? 

A story of a man born deaf and lives for 27 years until he learns sign language. And it changes the way he thinks. Gives him memories.

Rats not connecting spatial direction. Same with babies and adults given a verbal challenge 

A group of 50 deaf students, gather in a city and made their own language. A generation later, their language evolves from body motions to just wrist motion, making the sign language more efficient

7/17/16, 10:13:40 PM: Crystal Dang: I need a massage üò©
7/17/16, 10:27:50 PM: Kevin: no im sending it now
7/17/16, 10:27:52 PM: Kevin: Hello Sally,

I am greatly appreciative for the offer of employment from TribalScale and I would love to start work as soon as possible. 

After reading over the offer of employment, I have one question to help clarify the point of Intellectual Property and side projects. With respect to side projects that have the following conditions, where they are developed outside of working hours, and have been developed without using any of TribalScale's resources (laptops, smartphones), and the idea of the project is unrelated to the projects at TribalScale, does TribalScale have ownership of the side projects?

For example, if I am currently working on an application to crowdsource Pokemon GO spawn locations, which is unrelated to any of TribalScale's projects, and I continue to develop the application outside of working hours, does TribalScale have ownership of my application?

My second point of attention would be the compensation stated in the offer of employment. Throughout the weekend, I spent my time researching base salaries of software engineers in Toronto by searching online and by asking colleagues and mentors with the same position. I found the current average salary of a software engineer in Toronto ranged from $62,000 to $70,000.

Given that TribalScale is a young company, less than a year old, I am asking for a base salary of CAD $60,000. As TribalScale begins to scale up to 200 employees by the end of next year, each new employee is crucial in keeping the culture fun, exciting and a great place to learn and build. I believe, I will be a great asset to the company as I am joining with experience from a 16-month internship and experience initiating a startup. I also planning on staying at TribalScale for a long period of time, as I will be constantly learning from my colleagues and in soon time, mentoring new tribe members.

Once again, I am very grateful for the offer of employment and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

P.S. I have discussed with Emir during our meeting on Friday where I was granted a delayed start day of Monday, July 25. However, if an agreement on the offer can be made early enough, I am able to start work as soon as tomorrow, July 18.

Thank you very much!
Kevin

8/2/16, 9:30:29 AM: Crystal Dang: or chan can stop by my house to pick up before going dt
